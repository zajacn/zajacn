## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Natalia Zajac, I am a postdoc at the Max Planck for Evolutionary Biology. Currently I am working in the team of Nathalie Feiner on constructing a pangenome for lizards from the Podarcis genus. See FeinerLab github and https://feiner-uller-group.se/ for more info.

Previously, for 3 years and 4 months, I worked as a bioinformatics scientist at the Functional Genomics Center Zurich, a core facility shared between ETH Zurich and University of Zurich. I performed data analysis for research projects in the topics of population genomics, biodiversity genomics, experimental evolution and medical genomics. I specialized on long read sequencing (mostly PacBio but also Oxford Nanopore), bulk RNA sequencing, pooled sequencing, 16S rRNA sequencing and shotgun metagenomics/metatranscriptomics. We published two internal studies to help university researchers understand how technical sequencing decisions can influence their biological conclusions: [a comparison between short-read and long-read scRNA sequencing](https://github.com/zajacn/scRNAseq_Long_reads_vs_Short_reads) and [RNA sequencing performed on different input amount and amplified with different amount of PCR cycles](https://github.com/zajacn/PCR_Duplicates_RNA).           
Additionally, I taught metagenomic data analysis, a 3-day course running at FGCZ twice a year.[For the program and tutorials see here](https://github.com/zajacn/metagenomics_course_FGCZ).         
Together with Jonas Grossmann, I taught a bachelor and master student block course entitled "Research Cycle in Genomics". We won a micro_innovation grant from UZH for expanding resources for the course in [methylation patterns in Staphylococcus aureus evolving in the presence of molecules from Pseudomonas aeruginosa](https://github.com/zajacn/Saureus_6850_methylation).

Prior to that during my Phd at ETH and a short postdoc at University of Lausanne I worked on the evolutionary processes shaping the structure and function of the genome of Atriophallophorus winterbourni, a trematode parasite. (This repository)[https://github.com/zajacn/comparative_genomics_trematodes] refers to the following publication https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evab010.
